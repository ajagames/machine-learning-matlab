# Machine Learning, Datamining, And Statistical Pattern Recognition #

## 1 - Linear Regression ##
* Implement linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck.
* Fit the linear regression parameters to a dataset using gradient descent.

## 2 - Logistic Regression ##
* Implement logistic regression and apply it to 2 different datasets.

## 3 - Multi-Class Classification And Neural Networks ##
* Implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.

## 4 - Neural Networks Learning ##
* Implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.

## 5 - Regularized Linear Regression And Bias VS Variance ##
* Implement regularized linear regression and use it to study models with different bias-variance properties.

## 6 - Support Vector Machines ##
* Use support vector machines (SVMs) to build a spam classifier.

## 7 - K-means Clustering And Principal Component Analysis ##
* Implement the K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to compress an image.
* Use PCA to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.

## 8 - Anomaly Detection And Recommender Systems ##
* Implement the anomaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect failing servers on a network.
* Use collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies.
